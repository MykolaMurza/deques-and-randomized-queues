### Deques and Randomized Queues

> Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary
> data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

#### Components:

- **Dequeue.** A *double-ended queue or deque* (pronounced “deck”) is a generalization of a stack and a queue that
  supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.

- **Randomized queue.** A *randomized queue* is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen
  uniformly at random among items in the data structure.

- **Permutation.** A client program Permutation that takes an integer k as a command-line argument; reads a sequence of
  strings from standard input using StdIn.readString(); and prints exactly k of them, uniformly at random. Print each
  item from the sequence at most once.
